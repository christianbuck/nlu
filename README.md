Preprocessing Pipeline
----------------------

See prep/README.md


AMR Generation Pipeline
-----------------------
This is launched by `pipeline.py`. Required arguments are per-sentence JSON files 
generated by the preprocessing pipeline. Several examples are in the `examples` directory. 
E.g.:

    $ pipeline.py examples/wsj_0001.*.json examples/wsj_0002.0.json

See the bottom of `pipeline.py` for options (`-e` for error tolerance, `-v` for verbose 
printing, etc.).
