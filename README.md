Environment: This project assumes Python 2.7 in a Unix or similar environment.

External resources: The `lex` module uses Ulf's morphological lexicon file, if it is available; 
it is not included in version control because of its size (20M). The file or a symlink to it 
should be at `nlu/EnglMorphFullCache.txt`.
